<h1 (mouseenter)="cambiaColore()" (mouseleave)="rimuoviColore()" #text>
    On mouse hover, renderer2 is going to apply a css class
</h1>
<p>
    Rendered2 provide a layer between the DOM and the element (main difference with nativeElement).
    Is the correct way to Angular's DOM manipulation, because nativeElement only works in browser, NOT in service
    worker, desktop app, and and donâ€™t sanitize the data, so expose the app to XSS.
